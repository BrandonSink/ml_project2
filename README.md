Machine learning project for my master's program.

Exploring regression machine learning models to predict the number of days between a vulnerability being published to the NIST NVD and when it is added to the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catelog based on a CVSS score.

For education only. I do not recommend using any of these models for production.
